## 5.5.0

- Clean up version handling
- Prep for jupyter releaser
- Format the changelog

## 5.4.0

- Fix version_info
- Make generated config files more lintable
- Fix union trait from string
- Add security.md, and tidelift bage

## 5.3.0

- Fix traitlet name in docstring
- Re-support multiple-alias key for ArgParseConfigLoader

## 5.2.2

- Make `traitlets.__all__` explicit and validate in test.
- Fix `KeyError` in `Application.get_default_logging_config`.

## 5.2.1

- logging: Don't attempt to close handlers unless they have been
  opened. Fixes `ValueError: Unable to configure formatter 'console'` traceback.

## 5.2.0

Traitlets 5.2 brings a couple of updates and changes to traitlets, and
is recommended for all users. What follows is a non-exhaustive list of
changes:

- Application: add logging_config trait.
- Disambiguate the use of the term value in the example.
- Add mypy typing support.
- DOC: Add log example.
- Internal cleanup: linters, autoformatters, CI.

## 5.1.1

5.1.1 fixes compatibility issues with Python 3.10 (rc2).

## 5.1.0

Traitlets 5.1 brings a couple of updates and changes to traitlets, and
is recommended for all users. What follow is a non-exhaustive list of
changes:

- Removal of the `ipython_genutils` dependency, this should remove
  any direct and indirect reliance on `nose` and prepare traitlets
  5.1 for Python 3.10 and above compatibility, some test suite
  changes also accommodate Python 3.10 changes. If you package
  traitlets downstream, make sure to remove this dependency.
- Removal of `ipython_genutils` may have change the default encoding
  detected for the command line argument parsing when not utf-8. We
  expect this to affect a small portion of older windows version. If
  you encounter issue let us know.
- Stop recommendation of `CUnicode` in some circumstances as it's
  deprecated.
- Our test suite is now using GitHub action instead of travis CI. If
  you are packaging downstream using the git repository, you may
  have to exclude the `.github` folder now, and can remove exclusion
  of
- It fixes a parsing issue for list of one single element on the
  CLI.
- We reserve the right to remove official support for Python 3.7 in
  subsequent minor revisions.

## 5.0.5

- Support deprecated literals for sets, tuples on the command-line:
  `nbconvert --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags='{"tag"}'`
- Fix `from_string_list` for Tuples in general
- Fix support for `List(default_value=None, allow_none=True)` and
  other Container traits
- Fix help output for nested aliases and tuple traits

## 5.0.4

- Support deprecated use of byte-literals for bytes on the
  command-line: `ipython kernel --Session.key="b'abc'"`. The
  `b` prefix is no longer needed in traitlets 5.0, but is
  supported for backward-compatibility
- Improve output of configuration errors, especially when help output
  would make it hard to find the helpful error message

## 5.0.3

- Fix regression in handling `--opt=None` on the CLI for
  configurable traits with `allow_none=True`

## 5.0.2

- Fix casting bytes to unicode

## 5.0.0

(This is an in-progress changelog, please let us know if something is
missing/or could be phrased better)

Traitlets 5.0 is a new version of traitlets that accumulate changes over
a period of more close to four years; A number of internal refactoring
made the internal code structure cleaner and simpler, and greatly
improved the diagnostic error messages as well has help and
documentation generation.

We expect no code change needed for any consumer of the Python API
(ipywidgets, and alike), though CLI argument parsing have seen a
complete rewrite, so if you have an application that does use the
parsing logic of traitlets you may see changes in behavior, and now have
access to more features. There was also a cleanup of what was considered
a part of the public API, certain previously exposed utility functions
and types are no longer available. Please see an exhausive list below.

::: seealso
`commandline` docs for details about
command-line parsing and the changes in 5.0.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/issues) if you
find issues with the new command-line parsing changes.

    subclass of `Application`
- [#306](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/306) Add compatibility with the
  `trait` package for Dictionaries and add the `key_trait` parameters
  allowing to restrict the type of the key of a mapping. The

  application show it configuration, all the files it loaded
  configuration from, and exit.
- [#349](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/349) unify ability to declare
  default values across traitlets with a singular method `default`
  method, and [#525](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/525) adds a warning

  print help now have an equivalent that yields the help lines.
- [#413](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/413) traits now have a method
  `trait_has_value`, returning a boolean to know if a
  value has been assigned to a trait (excluding the default), in order
  to help avoiding circular validation at initialisation.
- [#416](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/416) Explicitly export traitlets

## 4.3

## 4.3.2

[4.3.2 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.3.2)

4.3.2 is a tiny release, relaxing some of the deprecations introduced in
4.3.1:

- using `_traitname_default()` without
  the `@default` decorator is no longer deprecated.
- Passing `config=True` in traitlets constructors is no longer
  deprecated.

## 4.3.1

[4.3.1 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.3.1)

- Compatibility fix for Python 3.6a1
- Fix bug in Application.classes getting extra entries when multiple
  Applications are instantiated in the same process.

## 4.3.0

[4.3.0 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.3)

- Improve the generated config file output.
- Allow TRAITLETS_APPLICATION_RAISE_CONFIG_FILE_ERROR env to override
  `Application.raise_config_file_errors`, so that config file errors can
  result in exiting immediately.
- Avoid using root logger. If no application logger is registered, the
  `'traitlets'` logger will be used instead of the root logger.
- Change/Validation arguments are now Bunch objects, allowing
  attribute-access, in addition to dictionary access.
- Reduce number of common deprecation messages in certain cases.
- Ensure command-line options always have higher priority than config
  files.
- Add bounds on numeric traits.
- Improves various error messages.

## 4.2

## 4.2.2 - 2016-07-01

[4.2.2 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.2.2)

Partially revert a change in 4.1 that prevented IPython's command-line
options from taking priority over config files.

## 4.2.1 - 2016-03-14

[4.2.1 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.2.1)

Demotes warning about unused arguments in `HasTraits.__init__`
introduced in 4.2.0 to DeprecationWarning.

## 4.2.0 - 2016-03-14

[4.2 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.2)

- `JSONFileConfigLoader` can be used
  as a context manager for updating configuration.
- If a value in config does not map onto a configurable trait, a
  message is displayed that the value will have no effect.
- Unused arguments are passed to `super()` in `HasTraits.__init__`,
  improving support for multiple inheritance.
- Various bugfixes and improvements in the new API introduced in 4.1.
- Application subclasses may specify `raise_config_file_errors = True`
  to exit on failure to load config files, instead of the default of
  logging the failures.

## 4.1 - 2016-01-15

[4.1 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.1)

Traitlets 4.1 introduces a totally new decorator-based API for
configuring traitlets. Highlights:

- Decorators are used, rather than magic method names, for registering
  trait-related methods. See `using_traitlets` and `migration` for more
  info.
- Deprecate `Trait(config=True)` in favor of
  `Trait().tag(config=True)`. In general, metadata is added via `tag`
  instead of the constructor.

Other changes:

- Trait attributes initialized with `read_only=True` can only be set
  with the `set_trait` method. Attempts to directly modify a read-only
  trait attribute raises a `TraitError`.
- The directional link now takes an optional `transform`
  attribute allowing the modification of the value.
- Various fixes and improvements to config-file generation (fixed
  ordering, Undefined showing up, etc.)
- Warn on unrecognized traits that aren't configurable, to avoid
  silently ignoring mistyped config.

## 4.0 - 2015-06-19

[4.0 on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/milestones/4.0)

First release of traitlets as a standalone package.
